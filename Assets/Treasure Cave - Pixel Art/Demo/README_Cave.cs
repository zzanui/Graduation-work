     Instructions how to use Parallax Script
     ----------------------------------------------------
     Step 1: Create an empty gameobject for each layer in the parallax background. (Background1, Background2 etc.)
     Step 2: Create child gameobjects in each background gameobject. Add a sprite renderer to each child. (1, 2, 3, ...)
     Step 3: Child 1 is the left most background sprite and the highest numbered child is the right most background sprite.
     Step 4: Set the sprites width in each backgrounds parallax script. The cave sprites are 320x128px with 100px per unit -> 3.2 width.
     Step 5: Set whatever parallax speed you think looks good and you're are all set.
